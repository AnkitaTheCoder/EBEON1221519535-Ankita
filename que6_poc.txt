6.Find the output and write explanation?
Answer:
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		byte b=127;
		++b;
		b++;
		System.out.println("Value of variable b:"+b);
	}
}

Output:
Value of variable b:-127
   Type casting a larger variable into a smaller variable results in module of larger variable by range of smaller variable.
   The range() method in the IntStream class in Java is used to return a sequential ordered IntStream from startInclusive to
   endExclusive by an incremental step of 1. This includes the satrtInclusive as well minimum number.
